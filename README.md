# cloudflare_project

My submission to Cloudflare's Full-Stack Internship program seen [here](https://github.com/cloudflare-internship-2020/internship-application-fullstack). Running this script requires the command line interface of [Wrangler](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler). It was my first time working with Cloudflare's Workers API and playing around with how cookies worked :)

## Running
